## **Update Notes**

2022.10.28 iWave++ has been accepted as one of the three reference softwares for IEEE 1857.11 Standard for Neural Network-Based Image Coding. Pytorch code (including both training and testing code) and pre-trained models can be found at (https://gitlab.com/iWave/iwave). To further improve compression performance, a series of improvements (such as an enhanced context model and an enhanced de-quant model) have been introduced in the new pytorch implementation compared to the original tensorflow version.

2020.9.4  Upload code and models of **Lossy multi-model iWave++**.

2020.8.26 Init this repo.

## **How To Test**
0. Dependencies. We test with MIT deepo docker image.

1. Clone this github repo.

2. Place Test images. (The code now only supports images whose border length is a multiple of 16. However, it is very simple to support arbitrary boundary lengths by padding.)

3. Download models. See **model** folder.

4. python main_testRGB.py. (The path in main_testRGB.py needs to be modified. Please refer to the code.)


## **Results**

iWave++ outperforms [Joint](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/8275-joint-autoregressive-and-hierarchical-priors-for-learned-image-compression), [Variational](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01436), and [iWave](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8931632).
